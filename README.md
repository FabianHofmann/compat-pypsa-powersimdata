# Optimize PowerSimData Models in PyPSA


The main purpose of this repository is to test the exportation of a [PowerSimData](https://github.com/Breakthrough-Energy/PowerSimData) model into [PyPSA](https://github.com/PyPSA/PyPSA) and a subsequent optimization.

The contained script requires the current master of the `PyPSA` repo, as well as [this branch](https://github.com/PyPSA/PowerSimData/tree/exporter-to-pypsa) of the `PowerSimData` package.
